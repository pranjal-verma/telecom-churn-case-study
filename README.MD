# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes telecom customer data to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. The model predicts whether a customer is likely to leave the service (churn=1) or stay (churn=0).

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer information including:
- Customer ID
- Churn probability (target variable)
- Various customer attributes and behaviors (detailed in the notebook)

## Files
- `telecom_koggle (1).ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and model development
- `output.csv`: Model predictions containing customer IDs and corresponding churn probabilities

## Model Output
The model generates binary predictions:
- 0: Customer likely to stay
- 1: Customer likely to churn

Sample output format (from output.csv):
